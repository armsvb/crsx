CRS was invented by <A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Ejwk/">J. W. Klop</A> in
1980 based on ideas in a <A HREF="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/REWRITING/MISC/AGeneralChurch-RosserTheorem.pdf">note by Peter Aczel</A>.
<p>
The idea of CRS is to allow rewriting rules that
allow for matching binding constructs and performing substitution
as part of rewrite steps.  The seminal paper on CRS is:

CRSX adds several extensions to the base CRS formalism that facilitates writing compilers and other syntax-directed transformation systems.
<ul>

<li>Special notations for using <em>embedded syntax</em>, even <em>higher order abstract syntax</em>.

<li>Special support for <em>symbol tables</em>, <em>environments</em>, and <em>attributes</em>, as used in compilers.

<li>A <em>polymorphic sort system</em> (which in practice means that CRSX systems are <em>contraction schemes</em>).

</ul>
