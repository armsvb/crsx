{"name":"Crsx","tagline":"","body":"Introduction\r\n====\r\nThe purpose of CRSX is to implement an extended higher-order rewriting formalism to facilitate writing compilers\r\nand other syntax-directed transformation systems, specifically:\r\n\r\n* Special notations for using embedded syntax, even higher order abstract syntax.\r\n* Special support for symbol tables, environments, and attributes, as used in compilers.\r\n* A polymorphic sort system (which in practice means that CRSX systems are contraction schemes).\r\n* CRSX systems can be compiled directly to native code (so far in C or Java (experimental)) for effective execution.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis program and the accompanying materials are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0, \r\nwhich accompanies this distribution, and is available at http://opensource.org/licenses/EPL-1.0.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
