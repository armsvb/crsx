 * Extension of terms to support use as contractum (rule right hand side).
 * <p>
 * Contracting with a valuation consists of building a copy of the contraction term,
 * except that a {@link Valuation} specifies how some specific subterm forms are dealt with differently,
 * as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>Variables are renamed, if defined.
 * 
 * <li>Meta-applications are substituted, if defined, with the {@link Substitute} obtained by {@link Valuation#getSubstitute(String)},
 *      where the meta-application arguments are inserted for the corresponding substitution variables.<p>
 * 
 * <li>Special "evaluation terms" of the form $[...] (with {@link Constructor#symbol()} == {@link CRS#EVAL_SYMBOL})
 *      are not copied but instead the result term is computed depending on the precise {@link Primitive} form of the term.
 *
