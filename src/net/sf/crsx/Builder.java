/**
 * In-progress construction of a {@link CRS} with limited scripting capability.
 * The CRS is constructed from a sequence of invocations of {@link #load(Sink, Term)},
 * where the parameter term is a "script" of CRSX rules and directives.
 * The effect of the invocation is that all rules in the script have been added to the system being built,
 * directives with system effects have been executed, and
 * the results of any term-generating directives have been added to the "context sink".
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * The <em>script</em> term is first evaluated (see {@link Contractum#contract(Sink, Valuation, net.sf.crsx.util.ExtensibleMap)}),
 * and then interpreted as a directive in one of the following forms:
 * 
 * <dl>
 * 
 * <dt>$Rule[ <em>name</em><sub>opt</sub>, <em>pattern</em>, <em>contractum</em> ]
 * <dd>Add rule to the CRS being built.
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><em>name</em> - an optional term where the constructor symbol is used as the rule name,
 *      and any arguments are rule annotations (see below).
 *  <li><em>pattern</em> - pattern term of rule (see {@link Pattern}).
 *  <li><em>contractum</em> - contractum term of rule (see {@link Contractum}).
 *  </ul>
 *  where the rule annotations should be of the following:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Free[v,...] - permits the variables v,... to occur free in <em>pattern</em> (and thus match free variables).
 *  <li>Fresh[v,...] - permits the variables v,... to occur free in <em>contractum</em> (and thus create fresh free variables).
 *  <li>Meta[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur only in <em>contractum</em> (and thus create meta-applications).
 *  <li>Discard[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur only in <em>pattern</em> (and thus contraction can delete the matched subterm).
 *  <li>Copy[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur more than once in <em>contractum</em> (thus permits contraction to duplicate matched subterms).
 *  <li>Share[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur more than once in <em>contractum</em>
 *  	<strong>and</strong> assert that they will always match normal form subterms (so do not need to be copied).
 *  <li>Weak[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur in patterns in weakened form, i.e., without all the possible bound variables (so matching does a variable occurrence check). 
 *  <li>Comparable[#,...] - permits the meta-variables #,... to occur multiple times in <em>pattern</em> (and thus match equal subterms).
 *  <li>Leaf - asserts that the result of contracting the rule will always be a normal form.
 *  <li>Shallow[v,...] - asserts that the variable v is shallow (occurs as direct parameter of the bound construction).
 *  </ul>
 *  Note that the standard parser allows the special form ( <em>name</em> : )?<em>pattern</em> &rarr; <em>contractum</em> for rules
 *  (where "(...)?" denotes optionality).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt><em>constructor</em>[( <em>directive</em> ; ... ; <em>directive</em> ; )]
 * <dt>( <em>directive</em> ; ... ; <em>directive</em> ; )
 * <dd>Process the nested directives.
 *      If the <em>constructor</em> form is used then the name of all embedded rules will have their name prefixed with the <em>constructor</em> symbol.
 *      The form 
 *      <blockquote>
 *          ( <em>directive</em> ; ... ; <em>directive</em> ; )
 *      </blockquote>
 *      denotes a sequence (right-recursive use of {@link CRS#CONS_SYMBOL} terminated with {@link CRS#NIL_SYMBOL}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Sort[ <em>name</em>,  ( <em>form</em> ; ... ; <em>form</em> ; )]
 * <dd>Set sort membership and form of indicated constructors.  Each <em>form</em> defines the sort and shape of one constructor as follows:
 * 		<blockquote>
 * 		<em>form</em> ::= <em>constructor</em>[ <em>argument</em>, ..., <em>argument</em> ]<br>
 * 		<em>argument</em> ::= <em>name</em> | *
 * 		</blockquote>
 * 		where each <em>argument</em> identifies the argument as either belonging to a specific <em>name</em>d sort
 * 		or * to indicate an unconstrained argument.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Term[ <em>term</em> ]
 * <dd>Send <em>term</em> to the context sink.
 *      The <em>term</em> is first evaluated (see {@link Contractum#contract(Sink, Valuation, net.sf.crsx.util.ExtensibleMap)}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Normalize[ <em>term</em> ]
 * <dd>Normalize the <em>term</em> with the (so far) constructed CRS and send the result to the context sink.
 *      The <em>term</em> is first evaluated (see {@link Contractum#contract(Sink, Valuation, net.sf.crsx.util.ExtensibleMap)}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Set[ <em>name</em>, <em>directive</em> ]
 * <dd>Process <em>directive</em> with the context sink set to
 *      store the result term in the <em>name</em> context variable.
 *      The <em>directive</em> is first evaluated (see {@link Contractum#contract(Sink, Valuation, net.sf.crsx.util.ExtensibleMap)}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Message[ <em>constant</em>, <em>write-file</em><sub>opt</sub> ]
 * <dd>Append constructor symbol name of <em>constant</em> to <em>write-file</em> (defaults to '' corresponding to System.out).
 *      The <em>constant</em> is first evaluated (see {@link Contractum#contract(Sink, Valuation, net.sf.crsx.util.ExtensibleMap)}).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Verbose[ <em>verbose</em><sub>opt</sub>, <em>write-file</em><sub>opt</sub> ]
 * <dd>Set verbosity to the integer level <em>verbose</em> (defaults to 1),
 *      sending the verbose messages to the <em>write-file</em> (defaults to '' corresponding to System.out).
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$EmbeddedParser[ <em>class</em> ]
 * <dd>Set the "embedded parser" to a new instance of the <em>class</em>.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Sink[ <em>class</em> ]
 * <dd>Calls the current {@link Factory}'s  {@link Factory#setSinker(Class)} with an instance of <em>class</em>.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$DumpRules
 * <dd>Send the entire CRS as a term to the context sink. 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$DumpRules
 * <dd>Send the entire CRS as a term to the context sink. 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$Compile[<em>generator-class</em>, <em>generator-dir</em>, <em>package-name</em>, <em>stand-alone</em>]
 * <dd><b>NOTE</b>: Subject to change. Generate a source program equivalent to the current rule system:
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li><em>generator-class</em> - class name of the implementation of {@link net.sf.crsx.generator.Generator} used to do the compilation,
 * 		<li><em>generator-dir</em> - directory to store the generated files in,
 * 		<li><em>package-name</em> - program unit name to use for the generated files (see generator documentation for details), and
 * 		<li><em>stand-alone</em> - if non-() then the generated files can run without the crsx.jar file (should be () for non-Java generators).
 * 		</ul>
 * <p>
 * 
 * <dt>$DumpRules
 * <dd>Send the entire CRS as a term to the context sink.
