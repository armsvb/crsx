<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The purpose of CRSX is to implement an extended higher-order rewriting formalism to facilitate writing compilers and other syntax-directed transformation systems, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Special notations for using embedded syntax, even higher order abstract syntax.</li>
<li>Special support for symbol tables, environments, and attributes, as used in compilers.</li>
<li>A polymorphic sort system (which in practice means that CRSX systems are contraction schemes).</li>
<li>CRSX systems can be compiled directly to native code (so far in C or Java (experimental)) for effective execution.</li>
</ul>
