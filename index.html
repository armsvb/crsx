<h1>CRSX&mdash;Combinatory Reduction Systems with Extensions.</h1>

CRSX implements higher-order rewriting based on <em>Combinatory Reduction Systems</em> (CRS) with some extensions.

<p>
The purpose of CRSX is to implement an extended higher-order rewriting
formalism to facilitate writing compilers and other syntax-directed
transformation systems, specifically:

<ul>
  <li>Special notations for using <em>embedded syntax</em>, even <em>higher order abstract syntax</em>.
  <li>Special support for <em>symbol tables</em>, <em>environments</em>, and <em>attributes</em>, as used in compilers.
  <li>A <em>polymorphic sort system</em> (which in practice means that CRSX systems are <em>contraction schemes</em>).
  <li>CRSX systems can be compiled directly to <em>native code</em> (so far in C or Java (experimental)) for effective execution.
</ul>

<h3>Downloads</h3>

CRSX releases come in two flavors:
<ul>
  
  <li><strong>HACS</strong> is a packaging of CRSX intended as an <em>introduction to compiler generation</em>.
    The package, including a manual, is distributed as <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall13/CSCI-GA.2130-001/hacs.zip">hacs.zip</a>.

  <li>The <strong>full CRSX</strong> release contains the low level engine with several examples but very sketchy documentation;
    it is available from the <a href="sourceforge.net/projects/crsx/files/">SourceForge CRSX download page</a>.
  
</ul>
If in doubt get the HACS release.

<h3>History</h3>

CRS was invented by <A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Ejwk/">J. W. Klop</A> in
1980 based on ideas in a <A HREF="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/REWRITING/MISC/AGeneralChurch-RosserTheorem.pdf">note by Peter Aczel</A>.
The foundational idea of CRS was to allow rewriting rules that
allow for matching binding constructs and performing substitution
as part of rewrite steps.  The seminal paper on CRS is:

<blockquote>Jan Willem Klop, Vincent van Oostrom, and Femke van Raamsdonk,
"Combinatory Reduction Systems: Introduction and Survey,"
<I>Theoretical Computer Science</I> <B>121</B>, pp. 271-308 (1993).
